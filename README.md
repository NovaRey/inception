Military Intelligence Analysis Web App
Military Intelligence Analysis Web App, a futuristic tool inspired by the cutting-edge workflows of special operations intelligence (e.g., 18F roles). This web-based application empowers users to generate comprehensive Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (IPB) reports using the PMESII-PT and ASCOPE frameworks, designed with a sleek, "Tron"-style fintech aesthetic. Whether you're a military strategist, a disaster relief coordinator, or a curious analyst, this app brings actionable insights to your fingertips!
âœ¨ Project Overview
This project is a dynamic web app that allows users to input a country, city, municipality, or country code to automatically generate detailed IPB reports. Leveraging mock data (with plans for real API integration), it analyzes Political, Military, Economic, Social, Infrastructure, Information, and Physical Environment factors (PMESII-PT) alongside Area, Structures, Capabilities, Organizations, People, and Events (ASCOPE). The interface features a neon-lit, futuristic design with font-switching options (Arial, Helvetica, Verdana) and interactive elements like clickable report sections for amplified details and a tracking log for inputs/outputs.

Mission: Provide a scalable, user-friendly tool for intelligence analysis and disaster preparedness.
Inspiration: Built from real-world special operations experience, with a nod to the iconic "Tron" operating system aesthetic.
Goal: Open-source collaboration to enhance military and civilian applications, with potential for ad revenue integration.

ðŸš€ Features

Futuristic UI: A "Tron"-inspired design with gradient backgrounds, neon accents, and smooth animations.
IPB Report Generation: Detailed reports with 4-5 sentence analyses per category, clickable for deeper insights.
Interactive Modals: Amplify information on any IPB section with input data and tracking history.
